Whatever need this

class Animal {
   public void move() {
      System.out.println("Animals can move");
   }
}

Yes we need it here.

class Dog extends Animal {
   public void move() {
      System.out.println("Dogs can walk and run");
   }
}

add from google account
public class TestDog {

   public static void main(String args[]) {
      Animal a = new Animal();   // Animal reference and object
      Animal b = new Dog();   // Animal reference but Dog object
 
   }
}

I think it is a good idea.
